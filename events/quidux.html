                Avengers! Inspired by the legendary IPL auctions, this Marvel-themed event invites you to step into
                the shoes of corporate strategists. Assemble your dream team by bidding on top talent from realms
                near and far, including roles like Marketing Manager, AI Engineer, and more.
                Each candidate will be displayed in a dynamic card format, highlighting their role, experience, and
                base price. With a fixed amount of funds at your disposal, your team must make shrewd decisions to
                acquire the essential roles needed to build a well-rounded, powerhouse company. The team that
                crafts the most formidable and efficient organization will emerge victorious. Will your team have the
                strategic prowess to outbid the competition and forge an unbeatable corporate force?</p>
            <h2>Rounds Overview</h2>

            <h2 class="section-title">Rules & Regulations</h2>
            <ol id="guidelines">
                <li>Each team must consist of 3-4 members.</li>
                <li>Each team will be allocated a set amount of rupees to bid on candidates. No additional funds will be provided, so plan your strategy carefully.</li>
                <li>Candidates will be presented in a card format, displaying their role, experience, and base price. These cards will be revealed 1-2 days before the event to give teams ample time to strategize.</li>
                <li>Bidding will take place in a live auction format. Each team must secure the minimum number of roles required to form a cohesive company.</li>
                <li>The winning team will be the one that:
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li>    Acquires the minimum number of required roles.</li>
                        <li>    Amasses the highest total credits from their selected candidates.</li>
                        <li>    Constructs a well-structured company with a balanced and diverse set of roles.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Teams must ensure a balanced distribution of roles within their company. Overlapping roles or missing essential roles will negatively impact the evaluation.</li>
                <li>Teams must manage their allocated amount wisely. Exceeding the purse limit will lead to immediate disqualification.</li>
                <li>Teams should consider both the individual base price and the overall synergy of their company structure while bidding. A well-rounded team with complementary roles will outperform a team with high individual prices but poor cohesion.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>Prepare for an epic battle of strategy and wit at the Asgardian Auction House, where only the most visionary team will claim victory!</p>
