        <h2 class="section-title">Rules & Regulations</h2>
        <ol id="guidelines">
          <li>Each team must consist of 3-4 members.</li>
          <li>
            Each team will be allocated a set amount of rupees to bid on
            candidates. No additional funds will be provided, so plan your
            strategy carefully.
          </li>
          <li>
            Candidates will be presented in a card format, displaying their
            role, experience, and base price. These cards will be revealed 1-2
            days before the event to give teams ample time to strategize.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bidding will take place in a live auction format. Each team must
            secure the minimum number of roles required to form a cohesive
            company.
          </li>
          <li>
            The winning team will be the one that:
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px">
              <li>Acquires the minimum number of required roles.</li>
              <li>
                Amasses the highest total credits from their selected
                candidates.
              </li>
              <li>
                Constructs a well-structured company with a balanced and diverse
                set of roles.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Teams must ensure a balanced distribution of roles within their
            company. Overlapping roles or missing essential roles will
            negatively impact the evaluation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teams must manage their allocated amount wisely. Exceeding the purse
            limit will lead to immediate disqualification.
          </li>
          <li>
            Teams should consider both the individual base price and the overall
            synergy of their company structure while bidding. A well-rounded
            team with complementary roles will outperform a team with high
            individual prices but poor cohesion.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Prepare for an epic battle of strategy and wit at the Asgardian
